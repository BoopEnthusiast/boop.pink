## In class crying

Currently sitting in class quietly crying because I cannot approach people. Today we are meant to talk with others about our game ideas, my friend left to talk with others because we've already talked about our game ideas with one another. I also worry about his actual liking of me but that's for another time.

I am unable to approach people, it is an impossibility. I do not know what specifically is causing it, if it's even caused by one of my disorders, although they certainly are not helping the situation. A psyche previously has said I experience agoraphobia, I brushed that off until recently. 

I can talk to people just fine when the conversation is going, maybe I'm a little awkward and don't know what to say most of the time but it feels like everyone is that way when I talk to them. I also am fine with going outside and talking with shopkeepers and the like, no issues there. Surely I couldn't have agoraphobia.

However, now I'm more leaning towards I must have it. I'm afraid of approaching people, generally. I don't know what it is about approaching people that I can't do but I just can't do it.
