Woah, that's a long list.

So, I'm going with my parents and one of their friends for 3 days: 
1. Leave Wellington on the 25th of May at 6am
2. Arrive in Auckland at 7:05am
3. Leave Auckland at 10:15am
4. Arrive in Tokyo Narita at 6:15pm

They leave 3 days later, leaving me alone from the 28th. They're going to Istanbul or something, and another place or two.

For a few days I'll be all alone (yay!).

Then, my bestie will join me from the 2nd of June. 

We'll be together in Tokyo until the 6th of June, in which we'll be setting out for Osaka.

We'll stay in Osaka until the 8th, when we'll come back to Tokyo and hangout there for another few days.

Finally:
1. Leave Tokyo Narita at 8pm
2. Arrive in Auckland at 9:25am
3. Leave Auckland at 1:10pm
4. Arrive in Wellington at 2:20pm

So that's my upcoming trip!
I'll be sure to share tons of juicy photos I take here on my blog, although I'll probably only show the best ones.
