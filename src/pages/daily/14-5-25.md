## Macbook days
Yoyoyo I bought a macbook. This is for numerous reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to: Being able to test/write Metal shaders, being able to make iOS apps, being able to test my games on mac, needing a decent laptop for my upcoming trip to Japan, needing a decent laptop for day-to-day life, and more! 

### NSFW MiniJam 17
I also happen to be working on the NSFW MiniJam 17! You can look it up, I'll share my game on everything when I'm done. So far I've learned quite a bit about making cars in Godot, mathematics, and minimaps! It's been good fun, there has literally been zero NSFW stuff yet from my side, all of the animations and models are being worked on by someone else while I got those basics down. It's been a really chill jam compared to most I've competed in. That's simply because it's a 9 day jam and not a 2 day jam, I thought it'd be intense for 9 days but nope, it feels like maybe a 4 day jam's intensity spread out across 9 days.
