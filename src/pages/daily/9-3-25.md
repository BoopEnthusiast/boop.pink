Today all I did pretty much was work on my blogging site. I was intermittently talking to other people and went to a TTRPG game as well.

The TTRPG game is the continuation of a therapy-like group where we play Vaesen. There isn't much to say about the continuation. I enjoy the group and I hope we can meetup more frequently.

Anyway, I added an RSS feed to this site!! I'll add the button for it soon, but I think I'm done for the day. It's 8pm somehow and I'm going to bed after maybe watching an episode or two of an interesting show someone described to me. Well, I only know that it has magic programming, which is right up my alley. It's The Irregular at Magic High School. I have no idea how good it'll be, I somewhat doubt it'll be any good.

I don't know what else to say about today but I wanted to make a log that commemorated me making this site. Hmm... What else to put here...
